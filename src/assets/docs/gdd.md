# Introduction

This is the basis of my work, where I wrote down everything I planned for this project since the start of it. Keep in mind that I tried building everything that's written here in just 5 days, but things could have taken a different turn or not everything was completed in the first release.

# Story

## Intro

The year is 2020, we are in the middle of World War III. Our story's heroine is Alex, a 25 years old Nigerian pilot. He works for a secret agency, where he learned everything about battle planes to take undercover missions against boko-haram air forces. Few days ago, his father, a Nigrian general, was kidnapped by the Boko-haram forces and is being held captive in their morthern stronghold.

Enraged at this news, Alex is on a mission to rescue his father by breaching each of the 5 main north command posts, where he will find clues on how to breach through the command post in which his father is located.

Now everything depends on you, the player, to guide her in this journey, but don't worry, the agency will help you with any means necessary each time you take down a post commander. Good luck!
