# How to play

- When the App is executed, you will see four buttons:
  - Leaderboard: Allows you to check the high scores leaderboard;
  - Credits: Shows you the credits scene, with everyone who helped me building this app;
  - Options: In the next screen, it allows you to mute the music and/or the sound;
  - Start: Starts the game.

- When the game starts, the story's intro and a dialogue will be played;
- When you are able to control the plane, use the ARROW keys to move and the SPACE key to shoot;
- After some time, the boss will appear and, if you are able to defeat it, you can move to the next stage and get a bonus!
- If you take 3 damage, the plane will explode, you will be able to restart the last stage;
- Your score will only be saved if you can pass the first stage!
